## Introduction

Self-Guided Denoising Learning (SGDL) is a new denoising paradigm which is able to collect memorized interactions at the early stage of the training,  and leverage those data as denoising signals to guide the following training of the model in a meta-learning manner. Besides, SGDL can automatically switch its learning phase at the memorization point from memorization to self-guided learning, and select clean and informative memorized data via an adaptive denoising scheduler to further improve the robustness.

## Environment Requirements

+ Ubuntu OS
+ Python >= 3.7.9
+ torch  1.4.0+
+ Nvidia GPU with cuda 10.1+

## Datasets

Three popular public datasets for recommendation are used in our research:

+ MovieLens-100K
+ [Adressa](https://www.adressa.no/)
+ [Yelp](https://www.yelp.com/dataset/challenge)

## Reproducibility & Training

To demonstrate the reproducibility of the best performance reported in our paper and facilitate researchers to track whether the model status is consistent with ours, we provide the best parameter settings (might be different for the customized datasets) in the scripts, and provide [the log for our trainings](./code/log).

+ MovieLens-100k with LightGCN

```shell
python main.py --batch_size 128 --lr 0.0005 --meta_lr 0.0005 --model lgn --eval_freq 5 --stop_step 8 --dataset ml100k
```

+ Adressa with LightGCN

```shell
python main.py --batch_size 1024 --lr 0.0005 --meta_lr 0.0005 --model lgn --eval_freq 10 --stop_step 4 --dataset adressa
```

+ Yelp with LightGCN

```shell
python main.py --batch_size 2048 --lr 0.0005 --meta_lr 0.0005 --model lgn --eval_freq 10 --stop_step 4 --dataset yelp
```

+ For other parameters and baselines, please refer to the settings in Section 4.1.4 of our paper.
